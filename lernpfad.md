# Python

## 1. Beginner

Write Python programs with up to 100 lines.

Achieving this goal includes six skills (or *competencies* as pro didacticians call them):

| area | description |
|------|-------------|
| applications | things you can get done |
| syntax | grammar rules, keywords and special characters |
| functionality | Python data types, functions and language constructs |
| elementary patterns | useful combinations of commands |
| debugging | techniques to discover and fix broken code |
| tools | helpers that make programming easier |

### 1.1 First Steps

* install Anaconda
* start a code editor
* write a Hello World program
* find and fix SyntaxErrors
* define string variables
* read data from the keyboard
* print the content of variables
* use keyboard shortcuts
* describe the code/debug cycle

### 1.2 Arithmetics

* use the arithmetical operators (`+ - * / ** // %`)
* distinguish integer and float numbers
* convert integers, floats and strings
* use functions from the `math` module
* look up functions from the `math` module
* calculate absolute and rounded values
* output numbers using format strings
* recognize and fix runtime Exceptions

### 1.3 Plotting

* draw a bar plot with matplotlib
* distinguish singular and composite data types
* store data in a list
* examine the length of a list
* inspect data types
* create data ranges with `range()`
* execute code examples from the matplotlib gallery
* recognize and fix bugs resulting from invalid lists
* the switch it off and on strategy

### 1.4 Iteration

* iterate over lists and ranges using a for loop
* indent code blocks
* calculate a list of function values
* implement a program based on a flowchart
* plot a parabola
* comment your code
* add diagnostic print statements while debugging
* recognize and fix semantic errors
* describe what impostor syndrome is and how to deal with it

### 1.5 Aggregation

* open a text file for reading
* collect data from a file in a list
* calculate a sum from a list
* calculate the mean from a list
* distinguish absolute and relative paths
* debug FileNotFoundErrors
* read and aggregate a single-column text file
* find functions for calculating descriptive statistics (min, max, median, stdev)

### 1.6 Conditionals

* filter lines matching a condition from a data file
* change the contents of a list
* write if statements
* sort and slice lists
* apply comparison operators and boolean logic
* use string methods
* read a file with two columns
* write a text file
* define the input, processing and output parts of a program

### 1.7 Conditional Loops

* write a number guessing game
* create random numbers
* use while loops to manage events
* describe a program as input, processing and output		
* create sample output to guide writing of a program
* debug endless loops
* trace the lifetime of strategies
* take breaks to solve difficult bugs

### 1.8 Dictionaries

* count words	using a dictionary
* distinguish mutable and immutable data types
* convert a dictionary to a list
* convert a list to a dictionary
* find most frequent words
* execute code partially and inspect the result
* read code to find logical errors
* the rubber-duck test

* divide code into functions
* name four different kinds of function parameters
* document your code with docstrings

## 2. Intermediate

Know enough Python to write, debug and maintain programs up to 1000 lines.

### 2.1 Data Structures

* create nested lists and iterate over them
* iterate over two lists with `zip()`
* store lists in dictionaries and vice versa
* use optimized data structures (np.array, pd.DataFrame)
* name limitations and caveats of float precision
* explain the difference between Unicode and ASCII
* convert integers to binary and back on paper
* convert integers to hexadecimal numbers and back on paper


### 2.2 Structuring Code

* distribute your code over multiple modules
* explain the advantages of generators over normal functions
* write classes to structure data
* write classes with a few methods
* refactor your code

### 2.3 Programming Tools

* export from Jupyter to a standalone script
* execute Python programs from the command line
* use a variable explorer (in Spyder)
* use a PEP8 style checker
* use the Python introspection functions
* use an interactive debugger
* use virtual environments
* write automated tests
* enumerate possible errors resulting from the Python environment

### 2.4 Programming Concepts

* explain what a Namespace is
* explain what reference counting is
* implement an algorithm from pseudocode
* use test data to guide development
* set the PYTHONPATH environment variable
* know differences between Python 2 and 3
* understand the Zen of Python
* conduct peer review of code

### 2.5 Packages

Solid working knowledge in a few of the following areas:

* Data Analysis
* Databases
* Numeric Computing
* Web Programming
* Image Processing
* NLP
* Machine Learning
* Data visualization
* Game Programming

## 3. Advanced

Write high-quality, optimized code and maintain Python programs with 10000 lines or more.

### 3.1 Proficiency in these areas:

* Algorithmics
* Profiling
* Inheritance
* Decorators
* Metaclasses
* Writing Python packages
* Deploying packages to pypi
* Concurrency, Multithreading and asyncio
* Design Patterns
* optimizing code with vectorization, a JIT or C extensions
* basic working knowledge of at least one other programming language
* actively contributing to the Python Community
