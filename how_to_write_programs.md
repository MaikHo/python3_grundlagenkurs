## Part IV: Structure

pipeline, method chaining
main: skeleton code
clean up (imports on top, remove unnecessary lines, clean style, comments, paragraphs
constants
Group code into functions
sample output, test data (define trivial input output examples)
testing
redundancy
state vs behavior (pro: state diagram, classes)
* structure with paragraphs, comments
* advanced: how to modularize code?
